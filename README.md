# dddice Foundry VTT Plugin

Roll 3D dice from Foundry VTT! Integrates [dddice](https://dddice.com) with Foundry VTT, providing you with a seamless dice rolling experience. Use dddice to overlay dice on your stream or simply share the fun of dice rolling in a private room.

## dddice vs. Dice So Nice

[Dice So Nice](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/) is another 3D dice plugin for Foundry VTT, but there are few key features that separate dddice.

- **Roll Anywhere** - dddice is an external service that allows you to roll 3D dice from our own site, D&DBeyond, Foundry, and other VTTs.
- **Synced Rolls** - Even better, dddice syncs rolls from all these platforms for a seamless rolling experience, no matter where you are.
- **Streaming Mode** - dddice's Streaming Mode renders your party's rolls transparently over your stream using tools like OBS or Streamlabs. [Learn More](https://dddice.com/for-streamers).
- **Customize Dice** - Easily customize dice and share with your friends (or foes) using our simple [dice editor](https://dddice.com/editor?ref=foundry).
